# Wellenst 🌿 – Wellness Landing Page

**Wellenst** is a modern, responsive landing page designed for a wellness and self-care startup. Built with HTML and Tailwind CSS, this project focuses on clean UI, soft gradients, and a calming user experience. The website was inspired by a premium template but restructured to reflect an original layout and UX with a wellness-centered brand identity.
